# Not everything is made by me

For this homework, my tasks were to create a working mini libc by implementing the following:
- ftruncate
- truncate
- lssek
- puts
- malloc
- mmap
- nanosleep
- sleep
- fstat
- stat
- string.c

I don't own any other file or directory like tests directory or *.sh scripts.

# How to run it?

You need to fork it on a UNIX based operating system and to run the script type ./tests/run_all_tests.sh. It will show 90 / 100 (10 points are awarded for coding style, but it needs docker file which I removed in the repository).

# About the homework

I've spent more than 40 hours on this homework. It took a long time to debug the bugs found while implementing.
